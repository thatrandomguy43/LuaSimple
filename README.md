# LuaSimple
Yet another Lua wrapper for C++ because i got fed up with another one i was trying to use.

Please write description of how to do stuff here. How do you do documentation?

Note to self, i need to add a proper distinction between C and Lua functions, as i have a reasonable way of dealing with Lua functions now.
